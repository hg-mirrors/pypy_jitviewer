You need to use PyPy to run this.  To get started, using a recent virtualenv
(1.6.1 or newer), virtualenvwrapper, and a recent PyPy (1.5 or trunk) to create a
virtualenv:

    mkvirtualenv --python=/path/to/pypy-c pypy-viewer

Now install the dependencies:

    pip install flask pygments simplejson

or

    python setup.py develop

It also requires pypy to be importable (as in source code), you can do this
by setting your ``PYTHONPATH`` enviromental variable.

Finally, run it:

    jitviewer.py log

where log is a logfile generated by
PYPYLOG=jit-log-opt,jit-backend:log pypy-c <args>.
An example log file comes with a checkout.
